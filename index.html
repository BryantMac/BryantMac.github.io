<p>
The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.<br> The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start.<br> The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal.<br> [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound.<br> [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start.<br> On your mark, get ready, start.
